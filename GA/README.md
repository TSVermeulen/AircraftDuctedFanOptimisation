# Ducted Fan Optimisation Framework

This folder contains the developed ducted fan optimisation framework, which is visualised in the diagram below. To execute an optimisation, the configuration needs to be set in config.py. An interface may then be chosen from main.py, main-parallelised.py, or main-parallelised-UNSGAIII.py, where the first and last implement the U-NSGA-III algorithm, while main-parallelised.py implements a basic "plain" genetic algorithm.
